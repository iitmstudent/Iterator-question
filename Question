11. Write Java code as instructed. [Iterators]
• Define two interfaces as follows:
– Interface Printable with method void print().
– Interface Iterable with methods boolean has next() and Printable get next().
• Define a class ComplexNum that implements Printable and has the following members.
– Instance variables r and i.
– Constructor to initialize the instance variables.
– Override print() method to display the ComplexNum in a formatted way as
shown in the test cases.
• Define a class ComplexList with the following members.
– Instance variable list which is an array of ComplexNum type.
– Appropriate constructor to initialize the instance variables.
– A private class ComplexIterator that implements Iterable and has the following members.
∗ Instance variable indx.
∗ Appropriate constructor to initialize the instance variable.
∗ Overrides the methods of Iterable.
• Define a class Test that has the main method. The main method takes the number of ComplexNum objects as first input, followed by values for each ComplexNum.
Then, it creates an object of ComplexList with an array that stores all the input
ComplexNum objects. Finally, it uses the Iterator to print the ComplexNum objects
in the proper format as shown in the test cases.
